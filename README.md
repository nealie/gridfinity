# gridfinity
GridFinity designs using CadQuery.

- gridfinity.py - Basic library to create gridfinity modules.
- gridfinity_battery.py -
    Generate tubular battery trays.
    
    I created this as no one seems to have made a tray for CR123 batteries. In the end, you
     can create a tray for any kind of battery, which is auto-filled according to it's size.
  
    The following kinds are defined, but in reality you just need to specify the diameter:
      AA, AAA, CR123, C, D.
